First Ruby on Rails App
=======================

This is my first sample application built with Ruby on Rails.

I'm just doing some experiments in order to learn this framework.

It is basically a list of authors and books and their CRUD operations generated by Rails Scaffold command. I just changed a little bit of the auto-generated code in order to add some extra functionality and used a twitter bootstrap template in the views.
